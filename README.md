# FinalProject
using a public dataset for ML 
Abstract


This Final Project explores the potential of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify gastrointestinal images of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract with high accuracy, while preserving fine details in the deeper layers. Additionally, the study evaluates the usability of the proposed model in improving the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions in poor and low-income countries through medical student training and telemedicine. To enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions, this study also generates heatmaps to provide visual and explanatory information on the classification decisions. 

The proposed approach is evaluated using the Hyper Kvasir  dataset and the CrohnIPI dataset from the University of Nantes, which includes a large number of gastrointestinal images. The results demonstrate that the CNN model can accurately classify the images with a high level of performance, while also producing saliency maps that highlight the key features and regions of the image that contributed most to the classification decision. 

The findings of this study may have significant implications for improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, particularly in resource-constrained settings, and may help increase the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnoses through the use of machine learning algorithms.
